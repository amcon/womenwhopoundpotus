    <div id="about">
      <p id="first">WOMEN WHO POUND POTUS is the politically and gossip
      fueled comedy that spills the true tales of the real women who
      drove our Presidents really wild. Whether it was 69 in the situation
      room, whips in the West Wing or a romp in the rose garden, the broads
      with the biggest influence were the blackmailing female athletes,
      models, actresses and scandal causing staff, and these ladies never
      acted First Lady-Like.</p>
      <p>in WOMEN WHO POUND POTUS, a certain former
      intern receives an invitation to get back in action twenty years
      after first getting rug-burn in the oval office. As she ponders
      pounding an orange POTUS, she gets guidance from the spirits of the
      women who stood (and lied down) in her shoes.</p>

    <h1>Produced by:</h1>
    <p>See You Next Tuesday Productions, founded by comedian Erica
    Vlahinos, is dedicated to creating in-your-face funny productions
    that combine art and activism. To do so, Vlahinos compiled a team
    that was 50% Broadway alums and 50% Millennial powerhouses. This
    pairing of experienced sophistication and youthful angst has created
    a production company that pushes the envelope, entertains and, most
    importantly, makes people laugh.</p>
