    <p id="about">From the mind of Erica Vlahinos, WOMEN WHO
    POUND POTUS is the politically and gossip fueled comedy that
    spills the true tales of the real women who drove our Presidents
    really wild. Whether it was 69 in the situation room, whips in the
    West Wing or a romp in the rose garden, the broads with the biggest
    influence were the blackmailing female athletes, models, actresses
    and scandal causing staff, and these ladies never acted First
    Lady-Like. In WOMEN WHO POUND POTUS, a certain
    former intern receives an invitation to get back in action twenty
    years after first getting rug-burn in the oval office. As she
    ponders pounding an orange POTUS, she gets guidance from the spirits
    of the women who stood (and lied down) in her shoes.</p>
